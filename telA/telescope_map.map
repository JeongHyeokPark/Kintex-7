WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock
   IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock IOB component <ucSpiSck> is placed at site <K17>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <ucSpiSck_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y8>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB
   and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites
   in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <ucSpiSck.PAD> allowing your
   design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error
   condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
